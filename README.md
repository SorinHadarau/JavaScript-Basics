# JavaScript-Basics
JS is a lightweight interpreted programming language that allows building interactivity into static HTML pages

Limitations with JS:
    *Client side JavaScript does not allow reading and writting of files (security reasons); 
    *JS cannot be used for networking applications because no such support available; 
    *JS does not have any multithreading or multiprocessing capabilities; 

The merits of using JavaScript:
    *Less server interaction (validate user input before sending page off to the server); 
    *Immediate feedback to the visitors (no waiting for page to reload in order to see if you have forgotten something); 
    *Increased interactivity (interfaces react at a hoover of a mouse or can ve activated via keyboard); 
    *Richer interfaces (including items such drag-and-drop components and sliders, giving a rich interface to site visitors);
