/*The <script> tag: 
In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags. 
The JS fubction below can be placed between <head></head> or <body></body> section of the HTML */
<script>
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My first JavaScript"; 
}
</script>

/*External scripta are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
Example below can be included in HTML file and calls the code written on myScript.js file; */
<script src = "myScript.js"></script>
/*Advantages of placing JS in external files:
    It separates HTML and code
    Makes HTML and JS easier to read and mantain
    Cached JS files can speed up page loads */
    
/*Using window.alert()
    You can use an alert box to display data */
<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>
/*Using document.write()
    For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write() */
<script>
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>

/*Using innerHTML
    To access an HTML element, JS can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
    The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content. */
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;

/*Using console.log()
    In your browser you can use console.log() method to display data. */

/*JavaScript Syntax - JS statements
    JS statements are separated by semicolon and represent instructions to be executed by a computer.
    JS statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords and Comments. */
var x = 5;
var Y = 6;
var z = x + z;

//JavaScript Literals - Numbers (written with or without decimals)
10.50
1001

//JavaScript Literals - Strings (text written with double or single quotes)
"John Doe"
'John Doe'

//JavaScript Literals - Expressions (can also represent fixed values)
5 + 6
5 * 10

/*JavaScript Variables
    Variables are used to store data values. An equal sign is used to assing values to variables. */
var x;
x = 6;

/*JavaScript Operators
    Assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables. */
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
//JS uses Arithmetic Operators ( + - * / ) to compute values.
(5 + 6) * 10

/*JavaScript Keywords
    Keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
    The var keyword tells the browser to create a new variable. */
var x = 5 + 6;
var y = x * 10;

/*JavaScript Comments
    Not all JS comments are "executed".
    Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
    Comments are ignored and will not be executed. */
var x = 5;  // I will be executed
// var x = 6;  I will NOT be executed

//JavaScript is Case Sensitive. All JS identifiers are case sensitive.
//The variables lastName and lastname are two different variables:
var lastName = "Doe";
var lastname = "Peterson";
//Also JavaScript does not interpret VAR or Var as the keyword var.

/*JavaScript and Camel Case
    Historically, programmers have used three ways to join multiple words in a variable name:
        Hyphens (first-name, last-name, master-card). Hyphens are NOT allowed in JavaScript.
        Underscore (first_name, last_name, master_card)
        Camel Case (FirstName, LastName, MasterCard). 
        In JavaScript Camel Case often starts with a lower case letter (firstName, lastName, masterCard).
        UNICODE is used in JS as a character set. */
        
/*JS Statements 
    This statement tells the browser to to write "Hello" inside the HTML element with an id="demo" */
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";

/*JS Programs
    The statements contained in a JS program are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written.
    In this example x, y, z are given values and finally z is displayed. */
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo".innerHTML = z;
//Ending statement with SEMICOLONS is not required, but highly recommended
//JavaScript ignores multiple white spaces.The white spaces are added to make code more readable (recommended around operators)
//If a script does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello. How are you?";

/*The Assignment Operator
    In JS the qual sign (=) is an "assignment" operator NOT an "equal to" operator.
    This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra: */
x = x + 5 //It assigns a value of x + 5 to x
//The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

//ONE STATEMENT, MANY VARIABLES. You can declare many variables with one statement:
var person = "John Doe", carName = "Audi", price = "200";
